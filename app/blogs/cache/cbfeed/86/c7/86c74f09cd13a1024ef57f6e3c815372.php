<p>TL;DR — There's a new WYSIWYG editor, and HTML5 all over. Update and enjoy :-)</p>


<p>It's now been thirteen months<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2014/12/13/Dotclear-2.7#pnote-1019-1" id="rev-pnote-1019-1">1</a>]</sup> since 2.6 came out. It's now about time (at last!) to move on. Dotclear 2.7, being released today, is less spectacular than the previous version, with its updated administration graphics chart, but it brings forth significative changes for users (on the admin side) and its rendering (on the public side).</p>


<h3>On the admin side</h3>


<p>We have integrated (she typed, as if <em>she</em> had done any of that) a new editor, dcCKEditor, which is built, as you can imagine, on the CKEditor library. You will therefore find a more advanced editor (presentation-wise). The old editor is still here, and is now called dcLegacyEditor.</p>


<p>As several editors (two with this version) can be installed, you'll have to pick your favorite for each of the proposed syntaxes (wiki and XHTML, so far). Go and have a look at the "My Options" tab under "My Preferences", and check the "Edition" frame. You'll probably need to clear your browser's cache as well.</p>


<p>It's not all on the administration side, as we have also started to integrate, together with the switch to HTML5, the main ARIA Roles. (If, like the author of that note, you are wondering what ARIA Roles are, you can read <a href="http://www.webteacher.ws/2010/10/14/aria-roles-101/">this</a>, which is the first link she decided to click on that topic. If you don't want to read, know that the first of those As stands for Accessibility and that accessibility is A Good Thing.)</p>


<h3>On the rendering side</h3>


<p>Well let's talk about HTML5 some more. We've implemented two sets of templates, upon which the basic themes are built. The first one is called "mustek" and corresponds to Dotclear's old default theme (that good old Blowup). The second one is called "currywurst" and corresponds to Dotclear's shiny new default theme, named... you guessed it, Berlin.</p>


<p>Both sets of templates and themes are now in HTML5 and include ARIA Roles. For those of you who use Dotclear's wiki syntax, do note that the XHTML code it produces is now HTML5 compatible.</p>


<p>You'll note that it is not any longer mandatory to copy the <strong>default</strong> theme repository when using an external repertory. You can also choose, in the blog's parameters, the jQuery version that must be loaded on the public side (both 1.4.2 and 1.11.1 are shipped with this version of Dotclear).</p>


<p>We certainly advise you, after having upgraded, to clear the templates' cache (see the Maintenance plugin), to ensure that your blog's rendering is up to date.</p>


<p>Moreover, new options have been added to let you tune your blog's appearance more finely. You can for instance deactivate widgets without needing to delete them. You can also define a number of notes to be displayed specific to the home page (and which can be different from that of the following pages).</p>


<p>Back to HTML5, now that audio files and videos will, as much as possible, be integrated to your notes with HTML5 tags (&lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;), degraded to Flash when supported.</p>


<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>


<p>A couple more things about this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag'n'drop on the admin side on touch screens is now possible;</li>
<li>You can activate protection against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">clickjacking</a> in the blog settings;</li>
<li>Comments preview is now optional (see Blog settings);</li>
<li>Hidden folders (with a name starting with a dot) are now hidden in the media manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the CHANGELOG file at the root of your brand new installation will give you a more detailed list of all changes.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>


<p>I'll hope you'll enjoy these changes! There's still a lot more work planned for future versions, including better accessibility (ARIA, Opquast <a href="https://checklists.opquast.com/en/oqs-v2">good practices</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php">ATAG</a>...), an alternate template engine (Twig), a new media library...</p>


<p>To conclude I'll thank all those who contributed (in particular <a href="http://open-time.net/">Franck</a>, <em>ahem</em>, but also all the others we don't dare naming in case we forget someone), to development, to design, to testing, to ideas, to the wild cheering by delirious fa... ah no wait, I was just supposed to translate something along the lines of support and cheers. More wild cheering by delirious fans for Franck et al., Dotclear users! It's crucial to people who contribute to an open source project like Dotclear on their free time only.</p>


<p>To sum it up, we (well, mostly <em>they</em>, as far as I am concerned) did a lot of work!</p>

This version precedes the final one by a few weeks. We were so eager to expose it to your rigorous and nevertheless gracious testing that we indeed decided not to wait until the final version to make it public. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce to you Dotclear 2.6-RC.</p>



<h3>The set</h3>


<p>Because every show needs an appropriate set, we have entirely repainted the stage. We therefore present you with a new visual identity, together with a set of icons that match the new color scheme:</p>


<p><img src="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/palette-traviata.png" alt="palette-traviata.png" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="palette-traviata.png, Oct 2013" /></p>


<p>We have also taken advantage of this opportunity to create an additional variation to the Blowup theme, Plumetis. Let it be known that our secret plans <del>to take over the world</del> include projects for major improvements in the development and configuration of themes in the next version (2.7).</p>


<h3>Stage direction</h3>


<p>We have also carried on our ameliorations in terms of ergonomics and accessibility. There is still a long way to go—<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">ARIA</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php">ATAG</a> and others aren't fully there yet—but we have made a number of noteworthy improvements in this domain.</p>


<p>The administration area will also be easier to use on various supports. Our objective for this version was to drastically improve the usage of the administration on mobile devices and small screens. Mission accomplished! A few pages aren't fully optimized yet, but we will work on them in the future.</p>


<h3>The orchestra</h3>


<p>Dotclear 2.6-RC is brought to you by a beautiful, merry, and prolific team work. We have sustained a few minor storms, but the mood was (almost) always delightfully good. While JcDenis, baby bottle in one hand, kid in the other, and keyboard on his lap was entirely recoding the maintenance and backup interface as well as the management of plugins and themes, nikrou was lovingly cooking up categories and media management in between two javascript implementations. Kozlika was making icons and torturing DOM, CSS, coders and users together. Lipki was aflutter around the widgets, closing ticket after ticket with artistic dexterity; so did sogox and bernardleroux. Dsls delved once again in the deepest of our basements to secure the stage and prepare the shows to come.</p>


<p>Franck Paul directed the whole with the big booming voice of the irrascible and grouchy dictator he ought to be. Cherry on top of this masterful production: a commit by Pep himself!</p>


<p><a href="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/commits.jpg" title="commits.jpg"><img src="http://dotclear.org/public/images/2.6/.commits_m.jpg" alt="commits.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" title="commits.jpg, Oct 2013" /></a></p>


<p>In the meanwhile, community managers Samantdi, Guillaume, Krazy Kitty (smoothly acknowledging yourself: one of the perks of translation) and Otir were, well, managing the community on the digital waves. Pinkilla, Tomer, Llu_ne, BG, mirovinbien, Jean-Michel, Aide Pour—yes, that's an odd name even for us—, Sacrip'Anne, Lomalarch, Philippe, xave, anthom, Patidou, Tetsuo, Cunégonde, Denis, Gilsoub, Pierre, brol, Armony and others also put their shoulders to the wheel, documenting, testing, animating the mailing list, writing whimsical minutes of our weekly IRC meetings, making coffee, updating the server's Dokuwiki, geolocalizing photos, and much more.</p>


<p>(Now's the point where we realize with utter dread that name-dropping will necessarily result, as we cannot but have forgotten people, in bitter chiding... and a few beers!)</p>


<h3>The singers</h3>


<p>That's you!</p>


<p>We need you to test this version, to <a href="http://dev.dotclear.org/2.0/newticket">report bugs</a>, to help updating <a href="http://fr.dotclear.org/documentation/2.6">the documentation</a>, to report potential translation mistakes (in French, English, and other languages while you're at it), to send us marshmallows.</p>


<p>So, in short: download, install, use, and let us know all about it!</p>


<p>We will publish here, before the final version of 2.6 comes out, more detailed information on the changes brought by this new version, particularly on the code side.</p>

<p>This branch of Dotclear, containing all versions from 2.5 to 2.5.3, will from now on be under maintenance only, mostly to fix critical errors should there be any. Indeed, we are now focusing our efforts on the next "major" version, 2.6, which we plan to release in the coming weeks (ideally in October, but time does fly...).</p>


<p>Regarding this future version, let's just say that we're very impatient to have it out, because it's much sexier than the current one!</p>

And I've always liked birthday parties to last a little bit longer. I've already shouted my own personal love for Dotclear <a href="http://amrhaps.net/english/post/2013/08/13/Happy-10-Dotclear">within my own walls</a>, as if becoming part of the team that is the English-speaking window of Dotclear to the world wasn't proof enough. Today, I'm here to tell you more about how it all happened...</p>    <p>The story of Dotclear started ten years (and one day) ago when, on August 13, 2003, Olivier Meunier, a young, promising, fiery and possibly slightly temperamental French developer, <a href="http://neokraft.net/2003/08/13/nouveau-cms" hreflang="fr">shared with the world</a> a piece of software he had written for his own use.</p>


<p>At first, Dotclear is a simple zip file, hosted by Benoît Clair. Support merely consists in exchanging emails with Olivier.
But quickly, interest for Dotclear starts to grow. A mailing list, then a forum appear; the first team is put together. Xave and Kozlika join Olivier and Benoît. Dotclear gains a written documentation and a support forum.</p>


<p>From the start, the goals of the team are clear: helping users, regardless of their computer skills, and leading them to autonomy. They must be able to install their own blog and take control over it without being specialists. Back then, personal weblogs are booming, and multiple online platforms welcome, free of charge, users that are soon disappointed by invading advertising and haphazard maintenance. In contrast, the alternative offered by Dotclear makes it possible to feel entirely at home in your own blog, and to give your readers a visual environment both original and aesthetically pleasing—Kozlika's incredibly refined first themes are miles away from what's then typically done.</p>


<p>Respecting good practices, without limiting their application to those in the technical know; giving accessibility a prime role, so that every and anyone can use Dotclear, including disabled users; united around the same desires and objectives, the team members become a tight group of friends, and this will always remain one of the prime aspects of the project. One day, a ten-year old boy writes to the forum to say he used Dotclear to open his blog on his favorite topic: firefighters. The team tells themselves they've managed alright.</p>


<p>Bloggers of all kinds have adopted Dotclear. Big names like Tristan Nitot, then president of Mozilla Europe<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-1" id="rev-pnote-988-1">1</a>]</sup>, or Daniel Glazman, chairman of the CSS Working Group of W3C<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-2" id="rev-pnote-988-2">2</a>]</sup>. No-names that would soon become big names, like Maître Eolas<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/08/14/Dotclear-and-us%2C-a-love-story#pnote-988-3" id="rev-pnote-988-3">3</a>]</sup>. And, above all, you, me, and all the others.</p>


<p>Along the years, how many blog notes written, read, passionately commented, in a frenzy! In the French-speaking world, Dotclear pages have been the theater of <a href="http://www.obni.net/dotclear2/?post/2006/11/13/870-kozlika-ou-l-art-d-etre-communicative" hreflang="fr">great friendships</a>, <a href="http://traou.net/blog/index.php?post/2006/03/12/91-ballade-de-jim-1-jim-en-bretagne" hreflang="fr">crushes</a>, <a href="http://sacripanne.net/post/2011/12/12/J-aime-le-voir-jouer" hreflang="fr">love</a>, <a href="http://soindesoi.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/01/17/Maternité" hreflang="fr">births</a>, <a href="http://open-time.net/post/2012/06/06/Aujourd-hui-un-jeu" hreflang="fr">the premature departures of beloved buddies</a>, <a href="http://lasoeurkaramazov.net/post/2013/04/08/Café-solidaire-et-frites-charitable" hreflang="fr">long discussions</a>, <a href="http://bricablog.net/dotclear/index.php/post/2005/05/04/522-ce-blog-ne-croit-pas-en-dieu" hreflang="fr">controverses</a>, <a href="http://www.kozlika.org/kozeries/post/2010/01/10/Les-bonnes-recettes-de-Maame-Kozlika-partie-2-%3A-la-galette" hreflang="fr">fits of laughter</a>, <a href="http://xave.org/post/2008/10/18/deception" hreflang="fr">disappointments</a>, <a href="http://www.mirovinben.com/blog/index.php?pages/Chic-des-Clics" hreflang="fr">beautiful pictures</a>, and <a href="http://archives.lanternebrisee.net/post/2013/04/20/Opéra%2C-premier-tableau" hreflang="fr">awe</a>. Or, in other words, life.</p>


<p>Year after year, the team grew bigger. Some had less time to give to the projects, others joined: Pep, Biou and Franck Paul have left the imprint of their personalities on Dotclear, while respecting its fundamental principles, for as the Prince of Salina in <em>The Leopard</em>, they knew that "if we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change".</p>


<p>Dotclear remains a free (as in both beer and speech) software, supported by a team of passionate volunteers with a little touch of madness. Currently, projects abound and here's what's being discussed on the mailing list:</p>
<ul>
<li>soon, very soon, so soon that it's actually already here, version 2.5.2;</li>
<li>fresh looks for the Dotclear and Dotaddict websites;</li>
<li>more and more improvements in terms of ergonomics, accessibility, and good practices;</li>
<li>a richer, more flexible editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even when you don't understand (or read) half the messages on the mailing list, it's fantastic to see so much activity around Dotclear. Users, including silent, anonymous, unknown users we've never met, stay at the heart of the team's concerns, and this warms my cold, cold heart.</p>


<p>We have no doubt that in the future Dotclear will become such a sexy, ergonomic and powerful engine that our friend <a href="http://embruns.net/logbook/2013/07/09.html#dotclear-2003-2013-rip" hreflang="fr">Laurent Gloaguen</a>, who loves to tease us about our imminent death and pretends to hate felines, will move his blog to Dotclear and, in the same swift move, adopt a cat. This remains, after all, our true main goal.</p>

<p>Here's the brand new 2.5.1, which only came out rapidly after our <a href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/07/13/Que-faire-tome-1-tester-la-future-2.5.1">call</a> thanks to the numerous testers who got together to help us finalize it. You've been perfect, don't change anything!</p>


<p>In this new version you'll find: bug fixes, cosmetic improvements, a better quality of thumbnails in the media manager, and, most of all, the replacement of the old Flash multiple media upload thingie by another thingie that does exactly the same but in Ajax and without any security vulnerability.</p>


<p>There's also a <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/patches/2.5-2.5.1.diff.gz">patch</a> for the developers who prefer this method.</p>


<p>May thousands of roses flower under the steps of <a href="http://www.nikrou.net/">Nikrou</a>, who has taken care of the conversion of the upload manager with selfless commitment and in the echo free desert of the last weeks. This silence, the last straw that made our <a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/07/21/Something-s-in-the-air">ex-but-still-in-the-team-boss</a> throw the towel, has been broken by a mailing list featuring ten times as many users as before and users at the ready every morning on the forum to test updates and report bugs.</p>


<p>I'll be back very soon to tell you more about what's being discussed on the mailing list, but that isn't the goal of that note.</p>


<p>For now, let's rejoice about that new step, update our installs, and for the Parisians, let's celebrate Monday night, from 7pm onwards, at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/node/1616811990">Quigley's Bar</a>.</p>

Happy times!</p>";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-07-21T23:48:00+02:00";s:2:"TS";i:1374443280;}i:15;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:63:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/07/21/Something-s-in-the-air";s:5:"title";s:22:"Something's in the air";s:7:"creator";s:11:"Krazy Kitty";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:2472:"    <p>Wow! Quite a lot has happened in the Dotclear community recently. Let me try to sum it all up for you.</p>


<p>On July 9th, <a href="http://open-time.net/">Franck</a>, who had been in charge of Dotclear since February, around the time when version 2.5 came out, decided to leave and slam the door on his way out.</p>


<p>While he was full of hopes, projects and enthusiasm, the community didn't follow. Team members, from lack of either time or eagerness, were less and less available. The new projects he announced (redesign the admin interface, replace the wysiwyg editor by something more advanced, give the Dotclear and Dotaddict websites a fresh look...) weren't enough to drive the team. Most of all, Franck missed what was for him the most important in Dotclear: the conviviality and team spirit. So Franck was quitting, and what would happen to Dotclear?</p>


<p>The door slamming certainly did one thing: suddenly, the community awoke.</p>


<p>People started talking, on Twitter and the Dotclear blog more particularly. On July 10th, <a href="http://www.kozlika.org/kozeries/">Kozlika</a> started outlining three possible futures for the project.</p>


<p>The first possibility is that a number of new, motivated and energetic developers (and, more generally speaking, contributors of all sorts) join Dotclear. The problem hasn't so much to do with money, marketing or communication, but mostly with contributions. With a vibrant community, there is no doubt that Dotclear can find its second wind.</p>


<p>The second possibility is to focus on simply keeping Dotclear afloat. No major changes, no projects for new features, simply a small team of developers, testers and webmasters devoted to fixing bugs and updating the code with new versions of PHP.</p>


<p>The third possibility is to slowly move to a close. Take the time (one or two years) to help users migrate towards new solutions, to ask the developers of other CMS for migration plugins, and so forth. This only requires a small team of people, with few programming skills, for a short time.</p>


<p>Then Kozlika opened the discussion on the dev mailing list. Everyone, independently of skills, was invited to join. Dozens and dozens of people did. Hundreds of messages were exchanged. Looks like Dotclear's not quite dead yet...</p>


<p>... And, indeed, we're releasing a new version !</p>


<p>Thanks to the wonderful community, changes are coming. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-07-21T23:31:00+02:00";s:2:"TS";i:1374442260;}i:16;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:53:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5";s:5:"title";s:12:"Dotclear 2.5";s:7:"creator";s:6:"Franck";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:3398:"    <p>As stated in our <a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/02/24/Upcoming-2.5">Dotclear 2.5 Release Candidate announcement</a>, this one mainly sees the thightening of bolts and screws everywhere, and dozens of tickets (say : a lot) closed (don't worry, we kept a few, thus there's still work to be done), some of them long overdue, whatever the reasons.</p>


<p>Among the differences beetween our RC and this release: a couple of bugs have been fixed, and more importantly, we had to fix two security issue comming from the multiple files upload system we're using. We are now planning to replace this (Flash) component by a new one, in Ajax. Expect a 2.5.1 one of these days. :)</p>


<p>The new version is, as usual, available there : <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip">http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip</a></p>


<p>Let me use my very first annoucement as the new skipper to talk you about a few things I would like to see being worked on in the near future<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5#pnote-971-1" id="rev-pnote-971-1">1</a>]</sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The revamping of the back-office should benefit from the work currently under progress on the <q>sexy</q> branch, which now includes <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a>, in order to make administration of your blog even more friendly and powerful.</li>
<li>Still in the back-office, it would be nice to replace the "wysiwyg" editor by something like <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a>. It is a big job, and we've had so far some unsuccessful trials... well, it is a bit of a holy grail but it would be cool to have that.</li>
<li>Make some room for Dotclear 2 by moving Dotclear 1 closer to the attic on Dotclear and DotAddict websites, and harmonise a bit their designs.</li>
<li>Progressively abandon PHP versions lower than 5.2<sup>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5#pnote-971-2" id="rev-pnote-971-2">2</a>]</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The main idea is to streamline Dotclear to the essential stuff and to externalise everything else in plugins (this is what the <q>sexy</q> branch is all about), to use whatever libraries others do better than we do (a template system, a wysiwyg editor, ...) in order to ease future developments. That being said, such deep changes might have a cost in terms of compatibility, but those questions will be dealt with at the right place, in the right time, we're not there yet.</p>


<p>If ever you're reading this English version of the announcement, it surely means you're a bit too far away for that, but if you have the occasion, feel free to follow <a href="http://fr.dotclear.org/blog/" hreflang="fr">the French blog</a>, where we plan to give details about a meet-up in Paris somewhere next month.</p>

<p>[<a href="http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/03/16/Dotclear-2.5#rev-pnote-971-1" id="pnote-971-1">1</a>] It will mostly depend on everybody's availability and abilities, of course.</p>

";s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"News";}s:7:"pubdate";s:25:"2013-03-16T01:42:00+01:00";s:2:"TS";i:1363394520;}i:17;O:8:"stdClass":8:{s:4:"link";s:53:"http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2013/02/24/Upcoming-2.5";s:5:"title";s:32:"Upcoming 2.5 (and a bit of news)";s:7:"creator";s:4:"xave";s:11:"description";s:0:"";s:7:"content";s:2625:"    <p>Today nearly sees the release of Dotclear 2.5: what we release today is a Release Candidate, meaning that we hope it's the real deal, but we'd like it to be tested by a few madmen before releasing it in the wild in a few days.</p>


<p>Why this waryness? We've had a big crash on Dotclear sister server: Dotaddict.org, and we had to stop everything to reinstall it from scratch, and I mean nearly really from scratch, as we discovered in the process that our backup plan hasn't been working for several months (and let that be a warning: automation is good, as long as you automatize some checks in the process.)</p>


<p>And because we had to stop working on that nearly finished 2.5, we prefer now to introduce it slowly, just to be on the safe side.</p>


<p>Users won't find any big changes in it: webfonts can now be used in Ductile and the daInstaller plugin is included in the main release. Other than that, there have been a whole bunch of small changes, both functional and cosmetic. Changes two are to be found for themes and plugins builders, and we can't even count all the small bugs that were fixed. As important for sysadmins: we are confident that Dotclear is now PHP5.4 compatible, for people using top-notch hosting.</p>


<p>Another important bit of news: having got a new job for the last 18 months, I finally had to admit that my schedule doesn't allow me to manage the project any more. It was really becoming a burden and a problem for the project, as I had often had no time to dwell into things. As nobody wants things to stall, waiting for my decisions or approvals, it became important to allow someone else to make those decisions, even if I stay in the team.</p>


<p>That's why we now welcome Franck Paul as the new project manager. It was an easy choice, as Franck not only is an historic member of the Dotclear Team, but is also the guy behind that new release, fixing most of the bugs single-handedly and driving the team for changes. Dotclear won't change: albeit with a role re-distribution, that's still the same team working on it.</p>


<p>And working we are, we're already working on several projects, stay tuned.</p>


<p>Do I forget something? Yep, the 2.5RC: it's now available in the nightlies at <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/nightly/dotclear-2.5-RC-r1105.zip" title="http://download.dotclear.org/nightly/dotclear-2.5-RC-r1105.zip">http://download.dotclear.org/nightl...</a>, or by defining DC_UPDATE_VERSION to "testing" in your configuration file, if you want to take advantage of the autoupdate feature.

But it calls for a small celebration, so here are three things:</p>


<p>We're starting with a new release. Dotclear 2.4.4 is mostly a bugfix release and you shouldn't notice any difference.

Grab the 2.4.4. here: <a href="http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip" title="latest Dotclear version">http://download.dotclear.org/latest.zip</a></p>


<p>In order to clear the backlog of things we'd like not to think about any more: the DC Loader, the script that allows you to install Dotclear in three clicks, has been updated, is now prettier, and is localization ready (only English and French are available, for now, though.) Grab it there: <a href="http://download.dotclear.net/loader/dotclear-loader.php" title="Dotclear one minute install script">http://download.dotclear.net/loader/dotclear-loader.php</a></p>


<p>Last but not least, a small pre-announcement: the team has started to work on a Dotclear version nicknamed "Sexy". It should coexist for a while with the good old official one and aims to rewrite a good part of its internals in order to be lighter, quicker, sexier!
